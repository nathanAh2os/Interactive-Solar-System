Future Features

1) Add minimum size to planets if scrolled out so you can still see where the planets are located. 
    If scrolled in more, give actual size of planets. ?

2) Add moon orbits to every parent satellite
    DONE --
    
3) Add comit orbits

4) Add main dwarf planet orbits
    DONE --

5) Change perspective camera rotational speed based on zoom level / distance from near plane
    i.e. the closer to the near plane, the lower the rotational speed needs to be
    Panning speed seems to already adjust to this, but I may need to do some further customization 
    to the panning speeds when very zoomed in. ?

6) Connect orbit path from end point to beginning point. 
    DONE --

7) Add a toggle menu to turn on and off certain things (i.e. dwarf planets, comets, etc. )
    DONE --

8) Add rotation to the x & y axis 
    DONE -- Had to add, up: [0, 0, 1], to cameraSettings to change up axis to z

9) Add textures (if possible) to dwarf planets
    DONE -- (added pluto, ceres, others are too far away for true realistic textures)

10) Only load one parent satellite texture at a time (the current parent target)

11) Add textures to applicable (large or close) moons
    DONE -- Some further large moons only have certain portions mapped, only mars irregular moons have textures, 
        other far out irregular moons will not have textures

Bugs

1) White outline appears when map is clicked on.
    SOLVED -- in solarSystemMap.css, add { overflow: hidden } property

2) Jagged moon orbit lines, more jagged further out from sun 
    SOLVED (took ten hours to fix) -- do not apply centerOfRotation transformations directly in orbit [],
    three js has issues with orbit lines of larger or very precise values, add position={centerOfRotation} to <Line />

3) When parent satellite position updates, moon orbit & positions do not update with it ? (need to test now)

4) Toggling off dwarf planets while looking at a dwarf planet does not remove its potential moons
    SOLVED -- useEffect(..., [filterOptions["Dwarf Planets"]])

5) zoomToTarget messed up

6) Satellite textures are sideways

7) Can zoom through and into objects
    SOLVED -- calculateClosestZoom()

8) Sometimes shaking of objects for a few seconds after moving camera(due to damping, but we still want to keep damping)

9) Dwarf planets toggled off & then back on while parent target is a dwarf planet does not load in moons until you click
    back on the dwarf planet (this edge case isn't a huge deal but could be a little annoying)

10) Attempting to zoom to sun causes a crash
    SOLVED -- Added very own sunInfoPanel & added sun info into dictionary, some logic to load appropriate infoPanel
