Future Features

1) Add minimum size to planets if scrolled out so you can still see where the planets are located. 
    If scrolled in more, give actual size of planets. ?

2) Add moon orbits

3) Add comit orbits

4) Add more dwarf planet orbits

5) Change perspective camera rotational speed based on zoom level / distance from near plane
    i.e. the closer to the near plane, the lower the rotational speed needs to be
    Panning speed seems to already adjust to this, but I may need to do some further customization 
    to the panning speeds when very zoomed in.

6) Connect orbit path from end point to beginning point.
    mercury fine
    venus fine
    mars bongo
    earth fine
    jupiter fine
    saturn bongo
    neptune fine
    uranus fine
    pluto bongo

7) Add a toggle menu to turn on and off certain things (i.e. dwarf planets, comets, etc. )

Bugs

1) If windows resized, map gets cut off
    Solved -- Created a resize event listener that reset width and height, then reset the scene and renderer

        1a) If resized and orbit control used, will stretch and disfigure orbit paths
            Solved -- Initialize smaller fov values on the perspective camera

        1b) Orbit controls ZOOM & PANNING are reduced when resized
            SOLVED -- Have no idea how I fixed

        1c) Camera initial z position get changed for some reason when first resized    
            SOLVED -- Have no idea how I fixed

2) White outline appears when map is clicked on.
    Solved -- in solarSystemMap.css, add { overflow: hidden } property

3) Orbit Controls on the 2D Renderer can get off from the solar map 
    Solved --

4) Dragging with right click on the orbit controls makes the planet labels go away from their intended planet targets
    Solved --
